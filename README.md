🎭🗣️ CultureCast AI – Folklore Narrator & Preservation Agent
💡 Project Idea
CultureCast AI is an AI agent that preserves and narrates traditional folklore, myths, proverbs, and cultural wisdom using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Users upload local language texts, scanned books, or images about their region’s heritage, and the AI agent extracts stories, translates them (if needed), and responds to cultural queries using local LLMs (via Ollama).

📦 Use Cases
Reviving lost or undocumented folk stories from scanned materials

Educational use in schools and cultural studies

Localized chatbot for cultural tourism apps

Bridging native culture with modern interpretation
